#Node-Skel
**A simple skeleton for Node.js projects**

Currently biased towards Angular.js on the front-end, but this can obviously be changed.
With time, I might make versions for different front-ends.

##Setup


```
npm install
```

A test suite has been written using **Mocha**:

```
npm test
```


**Start the Server**
```
node server.js
```
```
Server is listening on http://localhost:3000
```
